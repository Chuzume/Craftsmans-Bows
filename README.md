# Craftsman's bows
This is a simple and small-scale mod that adds four vanilla-style long-range weapons. 
<br>I made this as a mod creation and Java coding practice.

## Items
### Shortbow

- Faster charge, shorter range, and less damage
- Your movement speed doesn't decrease even while charging the bow, so you can run while ready.
- It seems to be good for quick attacks on mid-range enemies, or for keeping enemies at bay.
  
### Longbow

- Slower charge, longer range, and more damage.
- You will be zoomed in while holding the bow.
- It looks like you'll be able to snipe from even further away than with a normal bow.

### Shot Crossbow

- A crossbow that fires five arrows at once.
- It cannot be fired unless the bow is drawn all the way back.
- Fired arrows ignore enemy invincibility frames.
- You can't expect much accuracy and the range is short, but it is very powerful at close range.
- Although it looks like a crossbow, the enchantments it can apply are bow enchantments.
### Repeater Crossbow

- A crossbow with incredible rapid-fire.
- Fired arrows ignore enemy invincibility frames.
- When you aim it, it will begin charging, and after a while it will continue firing arrows.
- Once charging is complete, you will be unable to move at all.
- It is awful to use, and it uses a lot of arrows, but it has incredible destructive power.
- Although it looks like a crossbow, the enchantments it can apply are bow enchantments.
